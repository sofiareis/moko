## Technologies
To bring our idea to life, our team used a variety of tools to create moko. For the frontend, Figma was used to plan and design the app flow. React Native and Android Studio were used to implement these designs and develop an interactive interface. The backend of this project was hosted on an Amazon EC2 server, and it was built with Node.js, SQL, S3 for image storage, and a Google Maps geocoding API.

## Inspiration
Inspired by local farmers' markets, Moko aims to promote sustainable development by connecting producers directly to consumers.

Moko's mission is to minimize CO2 emissions originating from the logistics around food transportation and encourage communities to eat local and fresh produce, thereby supporting local businesses.

## What it does
Through Moko, farmers can buy and sell fresh produce within their local communities. The appâ€™s home shows local vendors who are near the user, allowing them to add items to their cart. Moko also features a sell function where vendors can create their own store and sell their produce to other users. Consumers and vendors alike can track their carbon footprint by using the "Footprint" function and check how they are reducing their emissions by buying or selling locally.
