# ðŸŒ¾ Moko 
Inspired by local farmers' markets, moko is an app that aims to promote sustainable development by minimizing CO2 emissions from food transportation and encouraging eating local and fresh produce. Moko also strives to encourage discovery and support for local businesses and foster community bonding.

## What it does

Through Moko, users can buy and sell fresh produce within their local communities. The appâ€™s home shows local vendors who are near the user, allowing them to add items to their cart. Moko also features a sell function where users can create their own store and sell their produce to other users. Users can track their carbon footprint by using the footprint function and check how they are minimizing CO2 emissions by buying and selling locally.

## ðŸ›  How we built it

To bring our idea to life, our team used a variety of tools to create moko. For the frontend, Figma was used to plan and design the app flow. React Native and Android Studio were used to implement these designs and develop an interactive interface. The backend of this project was hosted on an Amazon EC2 server, and it was built with Node.js, SQL, S3 for image storage, and a Google Maps geocoding API.

# ðŸ’¨ What's next for moko ?

In the future, we want to do more research and incorporate emission data in the app, and we hope to talk to local vendors about our app and work with them to improve its functionality!
